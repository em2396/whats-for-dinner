# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built an app that takes the decision making out of what to have for dinner. You can choose an option between a side, main dish, dessert, or entire meal. It solves the problem by randomly choosing from a selection of dishes to eat. If nothing sounds good, you can keep reloading until you get something that sounds good.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They would need the github link to my project, copy the link, and paste it into their terminal with 'git clone' before the link. Then, use code . within the directory to open VS code, or they can just open index.html to open the website. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am currently on week 3 at Turing and we had a little less than a week to complete this project. 

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project were to write CSS and HTML for the first time in cooperation with Javascript. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I really struggled with CSS. Before going into this project, I felt CSS would be easy because it is just the styling of a webpage (formatting too), but everyone says CSS is easy and I struggled with wrapping my head around it more than Javascript. I think I will be able to understand it more the more I use it, and this project was just dipping my toes in for the first time so to speak. It was a major win when I was able to get something to work. I struggled a lot with the cookpot image and text moving outside of the white background boxes. 
Another win was how comfortable I felt in JS. I may have overcomplicated some code to get the desired result but I did that to ensure the enitre meal wasn't returning something wrong and that when the user didn't select a dish type but clicked, 'let's cook!' there was an alert that said choose an option, vs before, where it said 'you should make: undefined'
